# Assignment 4: Fake News Detection on Twitter Data

This repository contains code and data for our project “Computational Methods to Detect Fake News on Twitter.” We compare three approaches, each of which reside in their own respective branch within this repo:

1. [**Text-Graph Ensemble**:](https://github.com/sophiakurz/NLP_HW4/tree/Text_Ensemble_Model) Combine BERT text embeddings with GAT graph features via logistic regression  
2. **Graph Contrastive Learning**: Learn robust graph representations using contrastive objectives  
3. [**GNN Replication**](https://github.com/sophiakurz/NLP_HW4/tree/Replication_Method): Reproduce the results of Harby & Zulkernine (2023) using multiple graph neural network architectures
